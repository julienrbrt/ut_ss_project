# Ringzz - Group 121

## Usage

To launch the game only few steps are required.

- Go the the 'gui' package
- Open the ``Ringzz.java`` file
- Launch it.

You can now play offline or online.
Don't forget to always replace the default player name (or highlight it, this permit the FocusListener to be triggered)
	This is not a bug, but a feature.
